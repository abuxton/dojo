Welcome to aoc25, maintained by abuxton.

## Description

Advent of Code 2025 <https://adventofcode.com/2025>

## Getting Started

this is just my scratch code for <https://adventofcode.com/2025>


### GitHub Copilot

- please note this year i'm using it to learn Rust and also prompt engineering my answers <https://github.com/Ranrar/rustic-prompt?tab=readme-ov-file>

> tell me which models you used for these solutions?

```bash
I'm using Claude Haiku 4.5 as my language model.

This is specified in my system instructions:

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.

All responses in this conversation — including the Rust implementations for Day 2 (AoC arithmetic), Day 3 (battery selection), Day 4 (paper rolls), the ping rootless ICMP code, the Makefile suggestions, and the README updates — were generated using Claude Haiku 4.5.
```

## Usage
